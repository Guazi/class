Daniel Zoo Organizer

SWEN 646 Class Project

FAQ:

All commands should be run from the ZooManager.java
ZooManager is commented as appropriate. 
Commands openFile and saveFile must be caught and handled with InvalidAnimalException.

Instantiate a zoo as follows:
ZooOrganizer myZoo = new ZooOrganizer();

The syntax for a new Animal is:
Animal name = new Species(name, birthDate, age, species)

Several existing files have been created for testing. These are animals.xml and animalsbad.xml
Please see the code comments in ZooManager for sample case usages.


Please call or e-mail with any questions.
